# Feature: Settings page
The Settings page should have the following settings, designed the way it is in the picture:
- Keep me logged in (with a Switch control)
- First day of the week: Picker with the options Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The Picker is on the right of the screen
- Manage categories button (Categories label left, chevron on the right)
- Skip the Notifications, Export Data, and Privacy and security settings of the picture

## Acceptance criteria
- There is a row with the label 'Keep me logged in', on the same row as a Switch control (no commands needed). This is the same as in the picture. 
- There is a row with the label 'First day of the week:' on the left, and the Picker on the left, and the subtitle as shown in the picture.
- The picker options are:  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- There is a Border with a Category title and subtitle 'Manage expense categories' and a chevron on the right as showed in the picture. 

## Other considerations
You must follow the rules set in the instructions.prompt.md file.
Ask rather use less and simple code than complicated code
Ask for after each implemented TODO if I agree with the implementation and if you should continue.
You should add namespaces to the GlobalXmlns.cs when they're used more than once throughout the project.
For the chevron icons and other icons, always use the font MateMaterialSymbolsOutlined and define the icons in the Resources/Icons.cs.
